# Guitar Shop

This is an early project from the bootcamp. Written only in HTML and CSS, the goal was to respect a maquette. I went as close as possible without managing to make it pixel perfect.  

However, I'd like to redo this one-page so it's responsive, and to have it be pixel perfect (or close enough) within the maquette's screen resolution.
